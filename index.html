			<p>The history of the beloved Garamond typeface begins in the Renaissance of the 16th century, with a man named Claude Garamond. Claude was a French type designer and punch cutter, and this typeface emerged at a time when art and knowledge were being celebrated across Europe. Claude had even created a typeface for King Francis I, which happened to be based on the handwriting of the King’s librarian. Garamond was actually created by Robert Estienne, who was a Prussian punch cutter known for his love for the ideals of ancient Rome and Greece. Estienne had created the first Garamond font using the punches created by Claude. Garamond’s typeface quickly gained popularity among publishers for its legibility and sleek, clean look. </p> 					</article>
			<aside>
			<p>Garamond does not necessarily have an original font. Garamond simply refers to the style of Claude Garamond, which consists of thick, rounded serifs. There have been several interpretations of Garamond, one of which includes Adobe Garamond, designed by Robert Slimbach. Adobe Garamond has a slightly different look compared to other Garamond type-faces, with the Adobe Garamond having slightly thicker stems. The several interpretations of Garamond were all based on the punches that belonged to Garamond himself, which found their way into the hands of other publishers and type designers after his death.</p>
				
			<p>While Garamond is praised for its renaissance aesthetic, it is commonly used in modern web-design, high-end publications, and brand design, its sleek but friendly design making it a popular choice for modern graphic designers. Garamond is praised for its legibility both digitally and traditionally, and is an especially popular typeface for printed books. Garamond was used in the American editions of the Harry Potter series, as well as the Hunger Games series and some Dr. Seuss books. Garamond offers a particularly sophisticated look when used for logos, magazines, and web pages. All in all, Garamond has left a lasting impression on the graphic design world, as the font has been appreciated around the world for many decades now. With its clean and sophisticated look, Garamond is always a reliable and interesting choice for any of your graphic design needs. </p>
